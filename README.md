# TagPlugin
Really simple plugin for 1.20.4+ (incl 1.21.4)
- `/tag <player>` force a player to gain tagged status
- while tagged, hitting another player will cause tag status to be transferred to them
- provides the `tagged` luckperms group when a player is tagged, can use a high priority prefix/suffix meta to show this in tablist + above names
